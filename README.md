This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution.  The initial Dockerfile attempts to install Python dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but fails because `requirements.txt` either does not exist in the build context or is in the wrong location. Additionally, the `CMD` instruction might not correctly execute the application. The corrected Dockerfile addresses these issues.  Please refer to the Dockerfile and Dockerfile_solution files for code examples.
